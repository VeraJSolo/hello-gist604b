# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Vera Jackson 
**Date:** October 26, 2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to make a professional repository, including with an appropriately-formatted README.md and the license.
- GitHub Actions and workflows that can be used to check code and formatting
- Issues can help teams collaborate by having a centralized location to submit questions or issues with the project or code. By having a public space to submit issues, collaborators can see if others have experienced similar bugs or had the same questions. The tags are also a usefal way to distinguish what type of issue is being posted and what type of solution it may require.
- Documentation is important in open source projects so all features of the project can be detailed out. This is important to properly communicate the tools to new users, and so all expectations can be laid out.

## Challenges and Solutions
I have been using GitHub for a few years now, mostly for classes, so many of the tasks were familiar to me, such as writing markdowns and scripts, creating folders, and submitting Issues). I haven't had to create me own respository in a professional (rather than private or academic) context, so that was exciting to learn and attempt! I was also new to the two-repository workflow - it is a cool way to connect repositories and workflows!

## Connection to My GIS Career
Using GitHub fully will help me in my GIS career by allowing me a place to submit my personal works. I plan to flesh out my GitHub page to be a proper portfolio that I can use in job searches. I am excited for the opportunity to use GitHub more in my professional field, especially with open source projects.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
