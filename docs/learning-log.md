# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Vera Jackson 
**Date:** October 26, 2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- [Describe 2-3 key things you learned about GitHub]
- How to make a professional repository, including a README.md and the license page
- [How Issues help teams collaborate]
- [Why documentation matters in open source projects]

## Challenges and Solutions
[Describe 1-2 challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Examples: creating folders in GitHub, understanding the two-repository workflow, writing markdown]
I have been using GitHub for a few years now, mostly for classes, so many of the tasks were familiar to me. I haven't had to create me own respository for a professional (rather than private or academic) context, so that was exciting to learn and attempt!

## Connection to My GIS Career
[Explain in 2-3 sentences how GitHub skills will help you in your GIS career. Think about portfolio building, collaboration, contributing to open source projects]

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
